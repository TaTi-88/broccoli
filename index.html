      <h2>General Info</h2>
      <p>
        Broccoli (Brassica oleracea var. italica) is an edible green plant in
        the cabbage family (family Brassicaceae, genus Brassica) whose large
        flowering head, stalk and small associated leaves are eaten as a
        vegetable. Broccoli is classified in the Italica cultivar group of the
        species Brassica oleracea. Broccoli has large flower heads, or florets,
        usually dark green, arranged in a tree-like structure branching out from
        a thick stalk, which is usually light green. The mass of flower heads is
        surrounded by leaves. Broccoli resembles cauliflower, which is a
        different but closely related cultivar group of the same Brassica
        species. It can be eaten either raw or cooked. Broccoli is a
        particularly rich source of vitamin C and vitamin K. Contents of its
        characteristic sulfur-containing glucosinolate compounds,
        isothiocyanates and sulforaphane, are diminished by boiling but are
        better preserved by steaming, microwaving or stir-frying. Rapini,
        sometimes called "broccoli rabe", is a distinct species from broccoli,
        forming similar but smaller heads, and is actually a type of turnip
        (Brassica rapa).

      <p>
        1. Good for heart health A study by Nutrition Research found that
        consuming steamed broccoli regularly lowers the risk of cardiovascular
        disease by reducing the total amount of cholesterol in the body. Another
        study in the US also found that increasing vegetables in the diet,
        especially brassica vegetables like broccoli, may reduce the risk of
        heart disease.
      </p>
      <p>
        2. Contains cancer-protective compounds While there are no single
        superfoods that can prevent cancer, and certain risk factors for cancer
        are unrelated to diet, there is evidence that eating a healthy diet can
        reduce the risk of cancer. A key component of broccoli is a
        phytochemical known as sulforaphane, which is also responsible for
        broccoli‚Äôs slightly bitter taste. Studies have shown that sulforaphane
        may play a part in enhancing detoxification of airborne toxins, such as
        cigarette smoke, and could help reduce the risk of certain cancers.
        Further research has suggested that broccoli may have anti-cancer
        properties and could reduce the risk of prostate cancer. Broccoli
        sprouts are an even more concentrated source of these cancer-fighting
        compounds. You can easily sprout broccoli seeds on your windowsill, just
        like you would cress.
      </p>
      <p>
        3. May be good for eye health Broccoli contains the carotenoids, lutein
        and zeaxanthin, that, in 2003 and 2006 studies, were linked to a
        decreased risk of age-related eye disorders, such as cataract and
        macular degeneration. Broccoli also contains beta-carotene, which the
        body converts to vitamin A, a deficient of which is associated with
        night blindness.
      </p>
      <p>
        4. May support hormonal balance Brassica vegetables, like broccoli,
        contain a plant compound called indole-3-carbinol (I3C), which acts as a
        plant oestrogen and may help balance hormones by regulating oestrogen
        levels. I3C has also shown promise as a means of lessening the risk of
        oestrogen induced breast and reproductive cancers in both men and women,
        although more studies are needed in this area. Brassicas, like broccoli,
        appear to influence oestrogen metabolism, potentially shifting it to a
        more favourable composition.
      </p>
      <p>
        5. May support the immune system Being rich in sulphur, brassicas like
        broccoli may support gut health, and as a result improve your defence
        against infection. This is because sulphur supports the production of
        glutathione which is important for maintaining the integrity of the gut
        lining, as well as supporting its repair. As a potent antioxidant,
        glutathione works throughout the body protecting cells from inflammatory
        damage.

      <h2>Interesting facts</h2>
      <p>
        Broccoli is one of the oldest vegetables on earth. It did not exist in
        its wild form: scientists have found that this variety of cabbage was
        bred in the 6th-5th centuries BC. In the 1st century B.C., the Roman
        scientist Pliny described broccoli as a "blessed plant".
      </p>
      <p>
        Although broccoli was much loved in ancient Rome, the rest of the world
        was unaware of its existence. After Rome, broccoli was recognized in
        ancient Greece - more than 2,000 years ago. Then, centuries later,
        broccoli was introduced to Byzantium (modern-day Turkey), and from there
        it spread to the rest of the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        The name "broccoli" was popular only in Rome. In the rest of the world,
        it was called "Italian asparagus" - everywhere except in Germany. There,
        the cabbage was called "braun kopf" - brown head.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since then, more than 200 varieties of broccoli have been developed. And
        recently, scientists have created another variety, "Beneforte" - this
        broccoli contains three times more useful, anti-cancer substances than
        ordinary cabbage.
